  ## Installation
  To install the dependencies, run the following: 
  To generate a README, first run `npm install` . Enter `npm init` followed by `npm install inquirer`. The application can be invoked with node index.js

  ## Usage 
  When you run node index.js in your terminal, the app uses the inquirer package to prompt the user with a series of questions about your project and GitHub account.  Once all the questions have been answered, the data is collected and your README file will be created with fs.writeFile.  There you have it! A professional README without the need to draw up a markdown outside of the command-line.
